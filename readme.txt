== Description ==

Pin It On Pinterest places a "Pin It" button at the end of your posts, and allows you to predetermine what gets "Pinned" at Pinterest. Spawned by the idea of Jamie Swanson of [The Modern Tog](http://themoderntog.com) and developed by William Bay of [Flaunt Your Site](http://flauntyoursite.com "Web design, marketing and SEO for photographers").

Pinterest is one of 2011's fastest growing websites, with the potential for substantial amounts of traffic from users reviewing the Pins that users have posted.

Simply install it, and you will find a new form underneath your Post Editor where you can fill in:

1. Description.
2. An image to associate the post with.

When you've added both the description and image, you can publish your post, and you will have a new Pin This button under your blog post. It will also show the number of times people have pinned your blog.

the directory of the stable readme.txt, so in this case, `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` (or jpg, jpeg, gif)
2. This is the second screen shot

== Known Issues ==

* As Pinterest is relatively new, the number of pins have a lag time of around 15 minutes. So if someone Pins your blog post, you may not see that reflected right away. We imagine that this will speed up after sometime.
* The Pin This button does not appear when previewing in Chrome, but displays just fine when published.
